# About me
A flexible data scientist with broad analytical capabilities and a strong background in collaborative work. I have honed my skills through participation in a Data Science Bootcamp, concentrating on NLP, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, which has notably enhanced my expertise. My competencies span analytical thinking, mathematics, and statistics. Beyond my professional aptitude, I have consistently showcased my teamwork abilities as an integral team member. Currently seeking a new opportunity to further enrich my existing knowledge and expertise in the field of data science.



## My Projects: 
### 1. Performing sentiment analysis from Trustpilot reviews of DoGood Credit Union DBank by using LLM- Transformer Model BERT

### 3.Customer Satisfaction from Trustpilot reviews
This project explored customer sentiment in Trustpilot reviews using a comprehensive toolbox that combined web scraping, machine learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

### 4. AI-vs-Real-Image-analysis
In this project I have used openCV and deep learning algorithms to generate a CNN model for predicting the images whether they are AI-generated or real images. Prediction Accuracy reaches up to 79% of the model there is no sign of overfitting and the model is successfully predicting between AI-generated and Real Art pictures.

### 5. Iâ€™m currently working on a churn detection project for estimating bank customers' supscritptions.
